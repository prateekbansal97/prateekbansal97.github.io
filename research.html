        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my research page. Below is an overview of my key research projects and areas of interest.</p>

        <h3>Activation Studies of Non-Class A G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)</h3>
        <p>Since August 2019, I have been conducting activation studies on human GPCRs, specifically Class F, Class B,
            and Class C receptors. These receptors are crucial targets for various medical conditions, including brain
            cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, anxiety, and depression. My approach combines extensive millisecond-scale
            atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with information theory, data science techniques such as
            Markov State Modeling, and deep learning methods like autoencoders.</p>

        <h3>Understanding and Engineering Protein-Protein Interfaces</h3>
        <p>From April 2020 to September 2022, I explored the design rules of protein mutations that affect protein
            complex formation. This work aimed to understand how protein interactions can be manipulated to achieve
            desired outcomes, which has significant implications for drug design and development. A publication
            detailing this research was featured in ACS Central Science.</p>

        <h3>Free Energy Perturbations and Molecular Simulations</h3>
        <p>My expertise extends to free energy perturbations and various molecular simulation techniques, including
            all-atom simulations, coarse graining, unbiased/biased simulations, and umbrella sampling. These techniques
            are essential for understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems, providing insights
            into their stability and behavior under different conditions.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning in Molecular Dynamics</h3>
        <p>I apply machine learning techniques, such as generative neural networks and Boltzmann generators, to enhance
            molecular dynamics simulations. These methods enable the prediction and generation of molecular structures
            and behaviors, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of simulations.</p>

        <h3>Analysis Tools and Techniques</h3>
        <p>In my research, I utilize a variety of analysis tools, including cpptraj, MDAnalysis, mdtraj, and RDKit, to
            process and analyze simulation data. These tools help in extracting meaningful insights from large datasets,
            facilitating the understanding of complex molecular systems.</p>

        <h3>Current and Future Research Directions</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am focused on further elucidating the mechanisms of GPCR activation and exploring new machine
            learning techniques to enhance molecular simulations. In the future, I aim to expand my research to include
            more complex biomolecular systems and to develop novel computational methods for drug discovery and
            development.</p>
