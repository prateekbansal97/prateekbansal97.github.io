        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Prateek Bansal, a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC),
            specializing in computational chemistry. My research focuses on molecular modeling, simulations, and the
            application of machine learning techniques to solve complex biochemical problems.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UIUC, where I have maintained a
            CGPA of 3.7/4.00. I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of
            Chemical Technology in Mumbai, India, graduating with a CGPA of 9.23/10.</p>

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming: Python (Expert), Machine Learning (Intermediate, with experience in scikit-learn and
                PyTorch), Command Line Interface, Git and GitHub</li>
            <li>Molecular Modeling: Autodock, RosettaDock, Amber, OpenMM, GROMACS, NAMD, VMD, PyMOL, Chimera</li>
            <li>Statistics: Markov State Models, Mutual Information Calculations</li>
            <li>Simulation Techniques: All-atom simulations, Coarse Graining, Umbrella Sampling, Metadynamics, Free
                Energy Landscapes, Estimating Rate Constants</li>
            <li>Machine Learning: Generative Neural Networks, Boltzmann Generators</li>
            <li>Analysis Tools: cpptraj, MDAnalysis, mdtraj, RDKit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research Experience</h3>
        <p>My research work includes activation studies of non-Class A G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) using
            extensive molecular dynamics, information theory, and deep learning techniques. I have also explored design
            rules of protein mutations affecting protein complex formation. My work has been published in journals such
            as the Biophysical Journal and ACS Central Science.</p>

        <h3>Publications and Presentations</h3>
        <p>I have authored multiple research papers and have presented my work at various conferences, including the
            American Chemical Society Spring Meeting and the Annual Biophysical Society Meeting. My publications are
            available on platforms like Google Scholar and Biorxiv.</p>

        <h3>Honors and Awards</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A.T. Widiger Fellowship (2023-2024)</li>
            <li>Winner of the SCS Image Challenge (2022)</li>
            <li>Listed as an excellent Teaching Assistant (2021)</li>
            <li>University Fellowship at UIUC (2019-2020)</li>
            <li>National Winner of the "Design is in my DNA" competition (2018)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outreach and Mentoring</h3>
        <p>I am passionate about education and outreach, having served as the Head Lab Assistant for the CURIE Summer
            Camp at UIUC, where I mentored high school students and introduced them to concepts in chemical engineering.
        </p>

        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I am proficient in English and Hindi, with native proficiency in Marathi and elementary proficiency in
            Mandarin Chinese (HSK-2).</p>
